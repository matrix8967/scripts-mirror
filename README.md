# Scripts

Typical Scripts Repo / Dot Files repo. Little bit of a mess right now, but it's getting better.

To Do:

* Auto detect OS and vary the package manager/installation syntax.
* Add more NetSec Scripts for HTB / OSCP / PWK stuff.
* Centralize Common Scripts (`Dev.sh` / `Flatpaks.sh` / `Dots.sh`).
* Move this over to Ansible :)
* Add Headless / Server Prompts so Desktop/Laptop junk isn't installed (Steam, etc.)
