# Scripts

Typical Scripts Repo / Dot Files repo. Little bit of a mess right now, but it's getting better.

To Do:

* Add more NetSec Scripts for HTB / OSCP / PWK stuff.
* Move this over to Ansible :)
* Need to add generalized Firefox Profile to start with all the Addons, and privacy settings, etc.
